My TOS need to include:
- no spam
- no abusing the bot (for example, base64-encoding files and getting free cloud storage)
- Coppa stuff
- I'm not responsible for what you or your servermates put in the bot. I'll do my best to protect servers with Safe Mode enabled, but I can't guarantee anything
- How to figure out moderation:
  - Don't force all stories to be SFW
  - Probably just "you're responsible for what you say"
- I don't have to serve you, I can ban you or refuse you service if I want to (though I probably won't except for in dire circumstances)
- I'm not responsible for any damage, injury, costs, etc.
