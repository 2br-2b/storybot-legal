I will do my best to comply with all laws and regulations regarding privacy.

Per Discord's terms and conditions, I will:
1. comply with all applicable laws and regulations;
2. not infringe or violate any third-party rights (including intellectual or other proprietary rights or rights of privacy or publicity);
3. not access or use the APIs in a manner that is deceptive, unethical, false, misleading, or encourages or promotes illegal activity or infringement or violation of third-party rights; and 
4. not violate any other terms or policies with Discord.

I will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.

I access data thru Discord's API. I collect this data locally and store it on a local database. I will retain this data as long as it is needed and will delete it when it is no longer required or when the relevant user requests it. As of now, I do not share this data with third parties.

I use this data to:
1. make the bot function;
2. ensure that the bot works properly for users;
3. prevent spam;
4. ensure that my bot is functioning properly; and
5. serve any other needs that arise as the bot is developed (and these will be added to this list).

I will not share API Data with any third party, except in the following circumstances, subject to compliance with the Terms and applicable laws and regulations:
1. with a Service Provider;
2. to the extent required under applicable laws or regulations; and 
3. when a user of your Application expressly directs you to share their API Data with the third party (and I will provide Discord proof thereof upon request).

Except to the extent I am required to retain API Data under applicable laws or regulations, I will
1. promptly update the API Data upon request from us or the applicable user, and
2. promptly delete the API Data when:
  a. retaining it is no longer necessary for your Applicationâ€™s stated (and approved through App Review, as applicable) functionality that is permitted under the Terms;
  b. you stop operating your Application (whether on my own, due to an enforcement action by Discord, or otherwise);
  c. Discord requests I delete it;
  d. the applicable user requests I delete it; or
  e. required by applicable laws or regulations.
  
If a user asks me to delete information stored on them, I will do so as promptly as possible. Such requests can be made by messaging me via Discord. See my bot support server to contact me.

**I will not train any AI models on users' submitted stories without their express, opt-in consent**. I do not have any plans to do anything of this sort, but I'm leaving this in here just in case.

If you have any questions, you can join [my Discord](https://discord.gg/a28VUkyrxp) and I will be happy to answer any questions you have.
